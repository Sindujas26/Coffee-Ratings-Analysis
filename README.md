# Coffee-Ratings-Analysis
This presentation is based on my analysis about Coffee and the metrics based on which it is rated. 'Coffee Ratings' dataset is used for this purpose. This project was aimed at achieving 3 main goals. I not only wanted to explain the insights of data but rather wanted to give the audience a wholistic experience. Hence my objectives were,
1. To capture my viewer's attention and create interest. And so I began my visualization with interesting facts about coffee such as ' Divorce on account of terible coffee',      'Coffee send brazil to olymbics' etc.,
2. As the next step I wanted my viewers to engage and interact with my visualization. Hence I create an interactive dashboard, through which the viewers can interact and find the 'Scores of Coffee' of various countries
3. Finally I wanted to demonstrate that visualization is a powerful tool that delivers great insights even with some basic charts. Hence I created some simple scatterplot, bar charts etc., and gave insights about how processing methods affect quality, how some countries like Ethiopia, Panama - inspite of having high quaker count still stand among the top Coffee producers in the world and so on
